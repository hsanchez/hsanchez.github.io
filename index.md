Hi, I'm **Huascar** (pronounced wäs-kär), a Senior Computer Scientist at SRI's [Computer
Science Laboratory](http://www.csl.sri.com/). Before joining [SRI](https://www.sri.com),
I was a member of the [Software Introspection Lab](https://games.soe.ucsc.edu/sil) at [UC Santa
Cruz](http://www.ucsc.edu/), working with [Jim Whitehead](http://users.soe.ucsc.edu/~ejw/).

I received my PhD in Computer Science from [UC Santa Cruz](http://www.ucsc.edu/)
in December 2015, and my MS in Software Engineering from [San Jose State
University](http://www.sjsu.edu/) in 2006. My research interests are broad, spanning
AI for software engineering, program analysis/verification, source code analysis, and social cyber
security; program analysis for AI; and AI engineering for the practical and safe use
of AI across the SDLC. I study how the solutions that emerge in this space can be
used to both understand and evaluate complex software systems and to produce more
reliable and secure software.

I was the PI on DARPA Social Cyber and have successfully contributed to several
DARPA-funded efforts, including DARPA ARCOS and DARPA MUSE. As a DARPA Social Cyber PI,
I developed data-driven software introspection technology to protect open-source project
software supply chains from social and technical attacks.

<!-- My primary research area is applied
software engineering, with a particular focus on programmer productivity,
information retrieval, and human-computer interaction. -->

My [**<span>Erdös</span>**](http://wwwp.oakland.edu/enp/) number is **3**:
P. Schweitzer, B.D. McKay, and P. Erdös.
